## XP Core Values
* Communication
  * We maintained active and open communication across team members via discord and regular sprint meetings. This allowed us to increase transparancy within the group and remain on the same page throughout the project. It also made it easier to ask for help and collaborate on tasks.
* Courage
  * Many of us were new to the technologies and frameworks used in this project, but we continously followed the value of courage by stepping up and taking on features even if they initially seemed daunting or out of our scope of knowledge. Each of us took on new challenges in this project and this helped us all grow our skills and work better as a team.
